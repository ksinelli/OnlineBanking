# OnlineBanking
Repo for Online Banking App

This is my first Java application. It mimics some features of an online banking website. Users can create a username/password to login, 
create/update their profile, open/close accounts, make transactions, and view their transaction history.

All information is stored in a PostgreSQL database which is hosted online, for free, by ElephantSQL.

This program was written entirely from scratch by me, without any sort of "follow-along tutorial" or any code used from other websites. 
Once a final draft was completed, it was reviewed by the kind folks at Reddit, who gave ideas about improving and refining the code. 
All revisions were coded by me until a final version was completed.
